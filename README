= VlDeployment

This is a repackaging of VLCapistrano and related gems into Rails plugin form.

To use this plugin, add the following line to your Capfile if it is not already present:

  Dir['vendor/plugins/*/recipes/*.rb'].each { |plugin| load(plugin) }

(This line will already be present if you capified your application using Capistrano 2.1.0 or later.)

This plugin requires that the following plugins be installed:

* capistrano
